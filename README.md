# circleLimitG
A project inspired by Maurits Cornelis Escher, featuring a simple Circle Limit-style texture created using a pixel-driven image synthesis algorithm. The generated texture is then used to render a rotating and orbiting four-pointed star.
This was my third homework for the Graphics course at BME.

## Resolution
- 'r' - lower
- 'R' - higher

## Texture modes
- 't' - GL_NEAREST
- 'T' - GL_LINEAR

## Star edge angle
- 'h' - make it sharper
- 'H' - make it duller
